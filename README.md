## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict weather conditions using historical weather data. We use various machine learning models to make accurate predictions and evaluate their performance.

## Data

The `data` directory contains the datasets used for this project. The data is divided into two subdirectories:

- `raw`: Contains the raw data files as obtained from the sources.
- `processed`: Contains the cleaned and preprocessed data files.

For more details about the data and its sources, see the [data README](data/README.md).


## Scripts

The `scripts` directory contains the main scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction:

- `data_preprocessing.py`: Script for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- `model_training.py`: Script for training the weather prediction models.
- `weather_prediction.py`: Script for making predictions using the trained model.

For more details about the scripts and their usage, see the [scripts README](scripts/README.md).

## Models

The `models` directory is used to store trained models. The `saved_models` subdirectory contains the serialized models.

For more details about the models and their configurations, see the [models README](models/README.md).

## Results

The `results` directory contains the evaluation results and metrics of the trained models. The evaluation results are stored in the `evaluation` subdirectory.

For more details about the evaluation results, see the [results README](results/README.md).

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
